dataset:
1. A data class shall be designed for a specific data format.
2. A data class instance needs:
    i. data_path or dir. If it is a folder path, it means the data is not processed yet.
    ii. data_url: optional
    iii. tokenizer: has a default value
    iv. a fixed way to naming output files and save them with the data_dir
    v. is_processed: boolean. If False, we need to call prepare method in the data class.
